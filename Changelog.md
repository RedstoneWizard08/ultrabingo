# v.1.1.0

## Changes:
- Visual pass to make UI elements more in line with UI changes from the latest game update.
- Added the ability to right click on a level in the bingo card on the pause menu, to ping the level for the rest of your team.
- Changed text on the pause menu to better indicate possible actions (left click to move to level, right click to ping map, etc.)
- Times to beat on a level will now be displayed directly in the pause card menu when highlighting it.
- When a player (re)claims a level, the new time requirement is now displayed in the HUD message that's broadcasted to all players.
- In the case of a connection error, the client will now try to reconnect up to 3 times before failing and leaving the game.
- Added [StyleToasts](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/The0x539/StyleToasts/) to the whitelist.


## Fixes:
- Implemented an FPS cap and VSync force enable when accessing the bingo main menu in the hopes of further reducing freezes & crashes related to UI elements failing to render. (This is an experimental change and may remain if it successfully mitigates problems.)
- Better handling of error flow if bad stuff happens.
- Fixed an issue where enabling cheats in the base game, then joining a bingo game, would still show finished levels in a bingo as having cheats used. (This was only a visual bug that would display a level as having cheats used when cheats are forcibly disabled in a bingo game.)
- Fixed games in the game browser always showing only 1 player when there may be more connected.
- Fixed bingo main menu buttons remaining locked if unable to host or join a game.
- Fixed being able to input non-alphanumeric characters in the join game input field.
- Fixed 1-1, 5-1 and 7-3 secret exits still being accessible via out-of-bounds clipping when "disable campaign alt exits" is enabled.
- Potentially fixed UI elements in the lobby screen randomly appearing invisible.
